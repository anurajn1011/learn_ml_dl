Scikit-Learn Design (refer to documentation for robust treatment; all notes from Geron's text.)

Core Design Principles:
 - All objects share a consistent and simple interface: 
 - Estimators: any object that can estimate parameters based on a dataset. Example would be Imputer.
 - Transformers: Some estimators which can transform a dataset. 
 - Predictors: Given a dataset, some estimators can make predictions. Hence the name. Example would be Linear Regression
 
 - Inspection: All estimators hyperparameters are accessible via a public instance variables while all the learned parameters are accessible via public instance variables with an underscore suffix
 - Nonproliferation of classes: Datasets are represented as numpy arrays and hyperparameters are just python strings or numbers.
 - Composition: Existing building blocks are reused as much as possible.
 - Sensible defaults: Most parameters have default settings.
